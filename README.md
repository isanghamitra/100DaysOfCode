# My #100DaysOfCode Timeline

What could be a better start to the week than starting out with a challenge that would push me to learn daily and not lose track. I am starting with #100daysofcode challenge. I will code for at least an hour for the next 100 days!

Making a public commitment has proven to improve people’s ability to stick to changes and new habits. So let’s do this together!

Also, to make it visually appealing, I am putting together my learnings in Tabular form.
